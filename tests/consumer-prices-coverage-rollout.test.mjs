// #6059 — consumer-price coverage deploy-before-cron rollout handshake.
//
// #6022 shipped the eight-market coverage health registry to Vercel at
// 2026-08-02 10:55 UTC, hours after that day's 02:00/02:15/02:30 UTC
// scrape→aggregate→publish window had already run. All eight coverage keys read
// EMPTY (crit) and global health sat UNHEALTHY for ~15h while the underlying
// consumer-price data was fine. These tests pin the two gates that close the
// window without letting it rot into a permanent exemption:
//
//   ACTIVATION — the producer SETs a durable, versioned, no-TTL marker only
//   after publishing real per-market coverage. One-way: strict forever after.
//   DEADLINE   — softening also stops at a wall-clock timestamp compiled into
//   api/health.js, so a missed or failed first tick escalates on its own.
//
// Runs under the repo's data-test runner (`tsx --test tests/*.test.mjs`), which
// is why the consumer-prices-core TypeScript module can be imported directly.
